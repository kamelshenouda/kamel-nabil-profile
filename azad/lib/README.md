# Vendored libraries

The public site (GitHub Pages) serves the 3D viewer's libraries from here instead of a CDN, so it loads
even where cdn.jsdelivr.net is slow or blocked. `site/tools/export_pages.py` copies this folder to `lib/`
and points the viewer's import map at it. Only the modules the viewer imports, and what they import, are kept.

- three-mesh-bvh 0.8.3, MIT licence: `three-mesh-bvh@0.8.3/LICENSE`

The claude.ai artifact keeps the jsDelivr URLs: its page may load scripts only from a few CDNs.
